## Overview of the analysis:
This analysis is conducted to examine temperature data during the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii to determine whether a shop that sells ice-cream and provides surfing services would work during winter and summer seasons.

## Results of the Analysis:
   1) The average temperature for June and December is only 4 degrees apart (about 71 in December and 75 in June) which is a desirable weather to have ice-cream especially in June.
   2) The standard deviation for both months is consistent and relatively low (between 3 and 4 degrees). The standard deviation is a little higher in December suggesting more variation and changes in the weather.
   3) Both months observed a minimum temperatures lower than 68 degrees which might not be desirable for either services provided by the shop. Note that the minimum temperature in December was 56 degrees which is 10 degrees lower than that of June. Further investigation should be taken to determine the number of days where temperature dropped below 60 degrees.

## Summary:
This analysis showed desirable temperatures for ice-scream and surfing shop project in Oahu, Hawaii. An additional analysis was done to determine the total number of occurrences where temperature dropped below 60 during the two months. The results showed the total number of occurrences where weather dropped below 68 during the two months is as follows:

    1) June: 17
    2) December: 238

The results suggest that the month of June will be better month to provide services for ice-cream and surfing. The study team recommends additional analysis to study wind during the two months to have a better idea of feasibility of surfing.
